# MINIATURE SINATRA APP

## Learning Goals

- Build a web basic API with Sinatra and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

This is the backend part of the MINIATURE TRACKER project.It carries all the data
needed for the project to work effectively and achieve it's functionality and goal

The focus of this project is **building a Sinatra API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API.

## Requirements

For this project, you must:


- **Create** a new todo
- **Read** a list of all todos
- **Update** an individual todo
- **Delete** a todo

A `Todo` can be tagged with a `Category`, so that each todo _belongs to_ a
category and each category _has many_ todos.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

This repository has all the starter code needed to get a Sinatra backend up and
running. [**Fork and clone**][fork link] this repository to get started. Then, run
`bundle install` to install the gems.

After running bundle install in your terminal run `bundle exec rake server` to start
the backend data which will run in localhost

### Project objective 
The main objective of this project is to help people sample
their miniatures and also arranga e them accrodingly and as desired

All these data will be stored in the backend part of it
